Hi

Let me say that the apartment is more or less big. It has got a few forniture and has got wallpaper for all the apartment.It`s old but there`s well kept, confortable and it´s clean too.
At night pass the waste collection and it has the all services as light, gas, internet, TV.
It has got two bedrooms and in a room has a bathroom.There is a large kitchen where you cook barbacue and invite a some friends and there is an office with 2 (two) desks and 2 (two) computers for study.
At back there is a little laundry with roof and there is a little garden where you can hang the clothes for to dry. In the middle of the garden there is a large and old palm where is the house of some birds.The garden´s floor has got a beautiful grass with flowers.
Outside the apartment, on the street there are many clothes shops, so you can find fashion clothes.

The neighborhood is very safety, it hasn´t had robberies during ten years and the police men look out the area.
Since five months it hasn`t leaks on the roof and the floor haven`t had a problems.
There`s a grosery store on this road where I have had buying and two more blocks is the University where we will study.If you have a car, you can put it on a parking at this block.
The bathroom hasn`t had reforms since one year when we changed the sink and the floor.

If you apply for be my roommate you should be organizated and be clean, the bathroom also the office should be clean and tidy two times a week.
You should be careful with the water because hasn´t the pressure necesary and is needed to wash the clothes at night.
Please consider be tidy because I need to study for the exams and the disorder deconcentrate me.
Every month you should paid the part of the rent and me too.
We have a woman who always cooks at night for us so cook is not a problem she has a lot of menus including vegan menu.


I hope we can live together! Bye bye.
